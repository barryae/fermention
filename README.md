# **Fermention**

Bringing culture back to the social biome.

## **Proposal**

Fermention is a collaborative social app for all of the fermentation hobbyists interested in sharing their unique bubbly recipes. Our design is minimal, providing an infinite feed for in progress and finished ferments as well as functionality to post your own ferment recipes.

This app is intended for brewers, wine-makers, kimchi enthusiasts, pickle people, and everything in between.

Fermentation is an ancient cultural tradition in every human culture (and some animal cultures) that is at risk of being killed by large-scale food capitalism. We hope that this app will energize local communities of fermentation enthusiasts to not only provide a good hobby experience, but to reinvigorate this essential aspect of human culture.
